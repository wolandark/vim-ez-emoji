# vim-ez-emoji
An easy emoji plugin for vim written in vim9script.

**Requiers vim9**

# Installation

```
git clone https://github.com/wolandark/vim-ez-emoji.git ~/.vim/pack/plugins/start/vim-ez-emoji/
```

# Usage
Use `:ListEmoji` to get a list of the Emojis and their names.

Use _`emojiname:`_ and press space to complete them.

__Example:__ 

`smile:<space>` üôÇ

`gnu:<space>` üêÉ

__Tip:__
To get colored emojis in the terminal install the `fonts-noto-color-emoji` for Debian  and `noto-color-emoji-fontconfig` from AUR for Arch.

The list is much larger than this screenshot. This plugin probably includes more emojis than you will ever need but not too many to overwhelm.
