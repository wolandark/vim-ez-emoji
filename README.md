![demo](https://github.com/wolandark/vim-ez-emoji/assets/107309764/39010048-2573-417d-960c-f089fea5bef7)

# Installation
Use your favorite package manager or install using Vim packages.

```
git clone https://github.com/wolandark/vim-ez-emoji.git ~/.vim/pack/plugins/start/vim-ez-emoji/
```

## VimPlug
```
Plug 'wolandark/vim-ez-emoji'
```

# Usage
Use `:ListEmoji` to get a list of the Emojis and their names.

Use _`emojiname:`_ and press space to complete them.

__Example:__ 

`smile:<space>` 🙂

`gnu:<space>` 🐃

__Tip:__
To get colored emojis in the terminal install the `fonts-noto-color-emoji` for Debian  and `noto-color-emoji-fontconfig` from AUR for Arch.

The list is much larger than this screenshot. This plugin probably includes more emojis than you will ever need but not too many to overwhelm.
